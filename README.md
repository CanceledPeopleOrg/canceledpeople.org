## History

A similar version of this site was first published on https://canceledpeople.com
and quickly gained
[notoriety](https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1507497409441632262) online.
Shortly after, the site mysteriously
[disappeared](https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1552662397432827908), with
public requests to revive it. The site in this repository is a recreation of the
old one, by entirely different site admins in an attempt to keep the public
utility alive and useful for everyone.

## Building the site

To build the site locally, run:

```sh
$ npm install
$ node run build
```

And then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
