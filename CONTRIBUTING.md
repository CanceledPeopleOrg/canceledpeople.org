# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing. PRs for site improvements or to fix
bugs are welcome. Any content adjustments (e.g., to the [about page
principles](https://canceledpeople.org/about) should be discussed in a GitHub
issue before a PR is created, so we can openly debate whether changes are
necessary.

Note that we will not accept PRs for new submissions to the database, though
general corrections are welcome. **All new submissions** must go through the
[submissions page form](https://canceledpeople.org/submissions) on the website.
That helps us keep a single cenralized location of proposals.
